## Summary

> When I think of Functional Programming versus Imperative Programming, I think about the differences between lincoln logs and legos, this silly opinion piece is worth the read, if you think about language primitives like loops and conditionals and how they can box you in and make it really cumbersome to create and explore.

Functional JavaScript is the practice of using functional programming concepts in JavaScript. JavaScript is not a pure functional language, but you can leverage a lot of the core concepts of functional programming in the language with a little discipline. JavaScripts first class functions and its ancestory of scheme makes it possible to use functional patterns in the language. Actually, there is a function programming specification written for JavaScript called FantasyLand.

Functional Programming is based off of Lambda Calculus and Category Theory and makes extremely heavy use of short very terse naming. This can be very intimidating for beginners and also very hard for functional programming developers to explain the core concepts, because of the level of abstraction.

We are not going to get into the deep terminology, but discuss functional concepts at a level we all can understand and leverage in any language.

The first concept is declarative programming and really trying to find the right abstraction level for our application development.

The less code we write as developers, the less bugs, it is very hard to write 100% clean code, but by choosing the right abstraction level and applying testable and provable patterns we can write solid code. Solid code becomes much easier to maintain over time.
