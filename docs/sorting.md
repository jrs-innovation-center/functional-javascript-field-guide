Sorting in JavaScript can be a bit of a challenge, if you are not using lexical
sorting, then you have to use a comparator function.

## What is a comparator function?

A comparator function, returns one of three values:

-1
0
1

When returned to the array.sort, the sort can determine the placement of the next
value in the list.
